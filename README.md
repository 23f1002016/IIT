Hi there!![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)I'm Jash

Welcome to my page!
This is what my TDS project was all about:

* I scraped GitHub user data from Seattle using the GitHub API in Python - VSCode, filtering for users with over 200 followers. I found 518 such users for whom I collected project related data while respecting rate limits. Think of it as sifting through digital gold, one nugget at a time.
* While JavaScript reigns supreme as the most popular language, Haml boasted the highest average stars per repository! Could this be a hidden gem waiting to be rediscovered? 
* The project analysis revealed a weak correlation between the number of followers and public repositories. My recommendation to budding developers is to focus on building great projects, and not just amassing quantity. Basically, Quality > Quantity
